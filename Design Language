As a language designer, you should think about three questions:
1. How many keywords should be involved?
2. How many kinds of variables and arithmetic symbols should be involved?
3. How many kinds of sentences should be created?

For question 1, different language varies
For question 2, different language varies, but gennerally speaking, contains int, float, char, arr[], object{} etc. and arithmetic operators, logical operators and relation operators.
For question 3, usually three kinds of sentences are OK: sequenced, choosen, and iteration sentences.
